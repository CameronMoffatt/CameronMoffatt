### Hello!

I'm Cameron, coming at you from the scenic Maritimes, originally with a background in Chemical Engineering but found my true calling in Data. I'm deeply passionate about environmental sustainability and using data to drive meaningful and sustainable impact.

When I'm not deep-diving into datasets, I'm out embracing the great outdoors. I'm a big fan of endurance activities, usually found with my running shoes on or cycling through the countryside. This love for endurance sports mirrors my approach to problem-solving: persistent, resilient, and always pushing forward.
